Note:
This is a very simple example and is not intended for use in a real-world scenario. In practice, you would need to use more sophisticated features and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect fake cards. The accuracy of this code will also be limited by the quality of the reference data and the similarity of the unknown card to the reference cards.

Note2:
This is a high-level overview of the process, and implementing a complete solution for detecting fake Pokemon trading cards is a complex task that requires a good understanding of machine learning and computer vision. A more complete solution would also need to take into account factors such as variations between printing runs and different manufacturing processes.

Here is a basic outline of how to detect fake Pokemon trading cards using Python:

Gather information and examples of genuine cards to use as a reference.
This could be done by examining cards from official sets or consulting with experts in the field.

Create a database of features that can be used to identify genuine cards,
such as the size, shape, and font of the text, the images and artwork, and the printing quality.

Write a Python script to extract these features from an image of a Pokemon trading card.
The script could use image processing libraries such as OpenCV to perform this task.

Compare the extracted features with the reference data to determine if the card is genuine or fake.
The comparison could be performed using machine learning algorithms such as 
k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks.


Finally, the script should return a result indicating whether the card is genuine or fake,
along with a confidence score indicating the level of certainty of the result.
